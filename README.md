# üöÄ Real-Time Crypto Analytics Dashboard (with ML Forecasting)

> **Category:** Data Analytics ¬∑ Machine Learning  
> **Date:** May 2025  
> **Client:** Self-Initiated (Portfolio Project)

A fully automated cryptocurrency analytics dashboard that unifies **live price tracking**, **historical data analysis**, and **future forecasting** in one interactive platform ‚Äî powered by Python, MySQL, Facebook Prophet, and Power BI.

## üß† Problem Statement

> *‚ÄúI can track current prices‚Ä¶ or I can analyze historical trends‚Ä¶ or I can run future predictions. But not all in one place ‚Äî and not automatically.‚Äù*

In the high-volatility world of cryptocurrency, insights must be both fast and smart. This project bridges that gap by combining **real-time tracking**, **deep historical context**, and **ML-based forecasting** into a single dashboard ‚Äî built for traders, analysts, and learners.

---

## üéØ Objective

To track and predict cryptocurrency prices in real-time using end-to-end automation, smart ETL pipelines, and machine learning.

---

## üî® My Approach

**From Idea to Automation:**

- ‚úÖ **Live Tracking** ‚Äì Real-time data via [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com) for BTC, ETH, and DOGE (updates every 15 minutes)
- ‚úÖ **Historical Context** ‚Äì 3+ years of past data stored in a MySQL cloud database
- ‚úÖ **ML Forecasting** ‚Äì 7-day price prediction using **Facebook Prophet**
- ‚úÖ **Smart Tagging** ‚Äì Label system to differentiate Live, Historical, and Forecast data
- ‚úÖ **Automation** ‚Äì Fully automated pipeline with **GitHub Actions** (zero manual work)
- ‚úÖ **Power BI Dashboard** ‚Äì Dynamic UI with filters for coin, date, and data type

## üìä Why It Matters

This project isn‚Äôt just a dashboard ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **real-world solution** that:

- Helps **traders act fast** with real-time price updates  
- Empowers **analysts** to study trends and forecast patterns  
- Teaches **learners** about full-stack data systems ‚Äî from ingestion to prediction  

> üîÑ **Everything runs automatically. No manual execution required.**
