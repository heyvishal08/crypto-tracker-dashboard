> > [🔗 View Project](https://insightsbyme.framer.ai/projects/crypto)

A fully automated cryptocurrency analytics dashboard that unifies **live price tracking**, **historical data analysis**, and **future forecasting** in one interactive platform — powered by Python, MySQL, Facebook Prophet, and Power BI.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> *“I can track current prices… or I can analyze historical trends… or I can run future predictions. But not all in one place — and not automatically.”*

In the high-volatility world of cryptocurrency, insights must be both fast and smart. This project bridges that gap by combining **real-time tracking**, **deep historical context**, and **ML-based forecasting** into a single dashboard — built for traders, analysts, and learners.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To track and predict cryptocurrency prices in real-time using end-to-end automation, smart ETL pipelines, and machine learning.

---

## 🔨 My Approach

**From Idea to Automation:**

- ✅ **Live Tracking** – Real-time data via [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com) for BTC, ETH, and DOGE (updates every 15 minutes)
- ✅ **Historical Context** – 3+ years of past data stored in a PostgreSQL cloud database
- ✅ **ML Forecasting** – 7-day price prediction using **Facebook Prophet**
- ✅ **Smart Tagging** – Label system to differentiate Live, Historical, and Forecast data
- ✅ **Automation** – Fully automated pipeline with **GitHub Actions** (zero manual work)
- ✅ **Power BI Dashboard** – Dynamic UI with filters for coin, date, and data type

---

## 📊 Why It Matters

This project isn’t just a dashboard — it’s a **real-world solution** that:

- Helps **traders act fast** with real-time price updates  
- Empowers **analysts** to study trends and forecast patterns  
- Teaches **learners** about full-stack data systems — from ingestion to prediction  

> 🔄 **Everything runs automatically. No manual execution required.**
